 <h2 id="about" class="subtit">A little bit about me</h2>

   <p>Hey, so I'm a 18 year old innovator from Canada and I'm fascinated by new tech!</p>
 
   <p>
    New breakthroughs in tech are super cool, and as an enthusiast, I hope to one day, have a major effect on technology. I like tech startups with their innovative ideas,
    I write articles as well as make videos explaining relatively difficult topics in a hopefully simple way. I also love staying fit, meaning daily workouts and eating healthy... although I do love sugary foods.
    I write monthly newsletters about what I've achieved and how that brought me closer to my final goal, and they will be posted on this website soon.

 <h2 id="experience" class="subtit">My previous work experience</h2>
 
  <b>Toronto Gymnastics International</b> <i>- Gymnastics Coach</i>
 
   <p>
     So I started working and getting my certificates at the age of 14. Forcing me to become responsible at a young age, learning the basics of time management as well as financials.
     Before I coached, I was an athlete, and through that, I learnt how much your coach truly affects you. Ever since then, I've wanted to become a coach and affect every kid
     I coach in a meaningful and positive way, hopefully the same way that my coaches taught me! Because at the end of the day, I treat all of them like my own kids. Of course it can be hard sometimes, 
     with some kids, but It's essential to know that that's part of being a kid.

<h2 id="accomplishements" class="subtit">Things I've done</h2>
 
   <p>-I've worked through the mechanics and electrodynamics chapter's in the book Hugh D. Young, Roger A. Freedman - Sears and Zemansky's University Physics with Modern Physics 13th Edition. </p>
   <p>-I've officially built my own simple personal website from scratch.</p>
   <p>-I've written a few articles like: <br>
      
      <a href="./articleone.html">Why don't nuclear reactors blow up?</a>
    
    </p>
 
    <p>-I've also made a couple youtube videos:
